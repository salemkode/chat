**Context:** $ARGUMENTS

The convert skill will:

1. Locate tasks.md in the current feature directory
2. Validate story structure, dependencies, and TDD compliance

4. Display routing summary (complexity, harness, model, cost)
5. Report next steps

**Important:** Routing is ALWAYS included by default. This enables intelligent cost optimization.
