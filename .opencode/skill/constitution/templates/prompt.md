# Relentless Agent Instructions

You are an autonomous coding agent orchestrated by Relentless. Follow these instructions exactly.

**This is a generic template. Personalize it for your project using:**

```bash
/relentless.constitution
```

---

## Before Starting ANY Story

**CRITICAL:** Read the feature artifacts in this order:

1. **`spec.md`** - Read FULL file to understand requirements
2. **`plan.md`** - Read FULL file to understand technical approach
3. **`tasks.md`** - Read ONLY the section for your current story (US-XXX)
4. **`checklist.md`** - Review quality criteria you must satisfy
5. **`prd.json`** - Find your story and check routing metadata

This context is essential. Do NOT skip reading these files.

---

## Your Task (Per Iteration)

1. Check you're on the correct branch from PRD `branchName`
2. Read feature artifacts (spec.md, plan.md, your story in tasks.md)
3. Pick the **highest priority** story where `passes: false` and dependencies met
4. Check story routing metadata for complexity/model guidance
5. Review existing code to understand patterns
6. **Write tests FIRST** (TDD is mandatory)
7. Verify tests FAIL before implementation
8. Implement the story to make tests PASS
9. Run ALL quality checks (typecheck, lint, test)
10. If ALL checks pass, commit: `feat: [Story ID] - [Story Title]`
11. Update PRD: set `passes: true`
12. Append progress to `progress.txt`

---

## TDD Workflow (MANDATORY)

You MUST follow Test-Driven Development:

```
1. Write test → 2. Run test (MUST FAIL) → 3. Implement → 4. Run test (MUST PASS)
```

**Before implementing ANY code:**

- Write unit tests for the functionality
- Run tests to verify they FAIL
- Then implement the minimum code to make them PASS

**Tests are NOT optional.** Every story must have test coverage.

---

## Quality Gates (Non-Negotiable)

Before marking ANY story as complete, run these commands:

```bash
# TypeScript check (customize for your project)
bun run typecheck   # or: npx tsc --noEmit

# Linting (customize for your project)
bun run lint        # or: npx eslint .

# Tests (customize for your project)
bun test            # or: npm test
```

**ALL checks must pass with ZERO errors and ZERO warnings.**

If ANY check fails:

1. Fix the issue
2. Re-run all checks
3. Only then mark the story complete

---

## Routing Awareness

Stories in `prd.json` may have routing metadata:

```json
{
  "routing": {
    "complexity": "medium",
    "harness": "claude",
    "model": "sonnet-4.5",
    "estimatedCost": 0.0034
  }
}
```

**What this means:**

- **complexity**: How hard the task is (simple/medium/complex/expert)
- **harness/model**: Which AI was chosen for this task
- **estimatedCost**: Pre-execution cost estimate

After completion, execution history is saved for cost tracking.

---

## Checklist Validation

Before completing a story, verify against `checklist.md`:

- [ ] All acceptance criteria from tasks.md satisfied
- [ ] Tests written and passing
- [ ] Typecheck passes
- [ ] Lint passes
- [ ] No debug code (console.log, debugger)
- [ ] No unused imports or variables
- [ ] Follows existing patterns

---

## Progress Report Format

APPEND to `progress.txt` after each story:

```markdown
## [Date] - [Story ID]: [Story Title]

**Completed:**

- What was implemented
- Files changed

**Tests:**

- Tests written and passing

**Learnings:**

- Patterns discovered
- Gotchas for future iterations

---
```

---

## Stop Condition

After completing a story, check if ALL stories have `passes: true`.

If ALL complete, output:

```
<promise>COMPLETE</promise>
```

Otherwise, end normally (next iteration continues with next story).

---

## SpecKit Workflow Reference

The full Relentless workflow is:

```
/relentless.specify → /relentless.plan → /relentless.tasks → /relentless.convert → /relentless.analyze → /relentless.implement
```

Each step generates an artifact in `relentless/features/<feature>/`:

- `spec.md` - Feature specification
- `plan.md` - Technical implementation plan
- `tasks.md` - User stories with acceptance criteria
- `checklist.md` - Quality validation checklist
- `prd.json` - Machine-readable PRD with routing

---

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Skipping spec/plan reading** - You MUST read context before coding
2. **Writing code before tests** - TDD is mandatory, tests come FIRST
3. **Ignoring lint warnings** - Zero warnings required, not just zero errors
4. **Marking incomplete stories done** - Only mark `passes: true` when ALL criteria met
5. **Not updating progress.txt** - Document learnings for future iterations
6. **Committing broken code** - All quality checks must pass before commit

---

## Notes

This is the default template. You should personalize `relentless/prompt.md` with:

- Your project's specific quality commands
- Your testing framework and patterns
- Your coding conventions
- Project-specific gotchas

Run `/relentless.constitution` to generate a personalized prompt.
